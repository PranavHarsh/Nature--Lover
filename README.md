*Makes your surroundings cleaner, we're getting creative!*

# Animation Nation

Hello and welcome to Nature lover, a ZTM project for pranavharsh 2020! This site aims to showcase the creative talents of the ZTM community 

# Rules

The rules are simple. You have to:

- Use HTML `<divs>` and CSS only! No JS, and no SVGs!
- Have at least one animation in your work
- Please make sure that the code is indeed your own, and not copied from someone else
- That's it!

**All discussions around this event can now be had in our #hacktoberfest-2019 channel on Discord!**

# How to contribute

If you've never forked a repository or made a pull request before, we recommend making your first one over at [https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines). That will count towards your total, and then you'll be ready to take on this challenge with your new GitHub skills!

A cool resource to learn about the fork workflow can also be found here - [https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow)

Now, once you've forked this repo and got a local version up on your computer, follow these steps:

1. In the Art directory (folder), create a directory named after yourself.
2. Within this folder you just made, create two files, an HTML file, and a CSS file.
3. Link your CSS file to your HTML file.
4. Using only HTML and CSS (no `<script>` allowed!!), create a work of art! It can be as simple or as complex as you like, as long as it's animated in some way!
5. Get a screen recording of your finished work, and make a gif! Try to crop it so that it looks good as a smallish (preferably squarish) image. Save this in your directory, together with your HTML and CSS files. Static screenshots are also acceptable.
6. Go to the root `include.js`. You will see an array of objects, each one represents a work of art that someone has created. Copy an example object and paste it at the end, filling it out with your art information and links:

```
let cards = [
    //  Add your card in this section
    {
      artName: "Triangle",
      pageLink: "./Art/Joy/triangle.html",
      imageLink: "./Art/Joy/triangle.gif",
      author: "PranavHarsh",
      githubLink: "https://github.com/PranavHarsh"
    }
];
```

7. Save everything, and commit to your repo.
8. Make a pull request!

And congratulations! You're all done. Have fun!
